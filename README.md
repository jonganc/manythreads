# Many Threads website

The source for my website manythreads.net, made using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/).

Started using [the Gatsby starter blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) with some ideas from [Fabien Bernard's Gatsby TypeScript starter](https://github.com/fabien0102/gatsby-starter) (and probably some other stuff I can't remember).
